There are other functionalities as well in the “Markdown” drop-down, which are mentioned below. You can try these on your own.

 

Monospace fonts

Use a back single quotation mark ` on both sides to get monospace fonts.
Line breaks

Use <br> wherever you want a line break, as the notebook sometimes does not insert a required line break where you want it.
Indenting

Use > to indent text.
Use >> for indenting text further, and so on.
Bullets and numbering

Use a single dash, i.e., - , followed by two spaces to make bullet points.
Use a number and a dot followed by a space, i.e., 1., to make numbered lists.
Coloring

Use <font color = blue, yellow, red, pink, green, etc.> String </font> to give your font any color you want.
LaTeX equations

Use $ on both sides of text to write LaTeX equations.
